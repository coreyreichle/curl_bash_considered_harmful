In my years as a systems administrator, one of the key issues drilled into my head is don't run executables you don't trust.

Do you trust a random stranger, asking you to run arbitrary executables on your machine, with your personal data?  If so, please turn in your systems administrator credentials.

We need to stop suggesting this to users as a method to install things (Yes, looking at you Salt and Adafruit!) on our systems.  There are two more commands to use, to make it a bit more safe:

curl https://mydomain.tld/myscript.sh > myscript.sh && view myscript.sh ; chmod +x myscript.sh

If it's acceptable, then ./myscript.sh

This isn't too much to ask for some system security.  Give your exectuble a once-over before execution.
